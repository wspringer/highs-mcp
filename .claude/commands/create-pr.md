# Create PR

- Get the issue this branch is linked to.
- Create a PR for the current branch, using `gh pr create`, inserting the `Fixes
  #{issue number}` into the body. Also, in the body add a sensible description
  of the fix and draw attention to the specific areas of the changeset that
  perhaps need some verification.
